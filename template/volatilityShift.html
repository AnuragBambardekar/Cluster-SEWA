            VolatilityShiftAD detects shift of volatility level by tracking the difference between standard deviations at two sliding time windows next to each other. Internally, it is implemented as a pipenet with transformer DoubleRollingAggregate. Volatility shifts can occur due to various reasons such as changes in market sentiment, changes in economic conditions, news events, and other factors that impact market dynamics. Detecting volatility shifts can be important for investors and traders as they may indicate changes in market trends and present opportunities for profitable trading. The plot generated by the volatility shift detector shows the historical stock prices and marks the points where the detector has detected a significant shift in volatility. This information can be used by investors and traders to make informed decisions about buying or selling the stock. If a significant shift in volatility is detected, it may indicate a change in the stock's trend or a potential trading opportunity.
